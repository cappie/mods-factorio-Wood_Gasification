Version: 2.5.0
Date: 2020-03-18
  Changes:
    - Added Spanish, Italian and Portuguese translations using Deepl.com
    - Changed some Dutch translations
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed my broken changelog (I REALLY need automated tests and a changelog linter for these factorio mods)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.4.0
Date: 2020-03-14
  Changes:
    - Added Polish and French translations
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.3.0
Date: 2020-02-06
  Rebalancing:
    - Wood gasification costs 100 automation and logistic science (reasonably simple to research)
    - Wood gasification of bitumen to oil costs 400 automation and logistic science (it's simple science, but hard to perfect)
    - Advanced wood gasification costs 150 automation, logistic and chemical science (wood-to-oil easy-mode will take some effort)
    - Wood gasification uses 10 wood to produce 20 petroleum gas and 8 bitumen (80% efficient)
    - Wood gasification enables you to convert 32 bitumen into 1 solid fuel (75% efficient)
    - Advanced bitumen processing uses 32 bitumen and 200 water to produce 40 crude oil (90% efficient (crude oil takes another efficiency hit during refining))
    - Advanced wood gasification uses 20 wood and 200 water to produce 15 heavy oil, 15 light oil and 30 petroleum gas (90% efficient)
  Changes:
    - Changed the text string of Tar into Diluted Bitumen to be somewhat more scientifically correct, internally it's all still 'tar' for brevity.
    - Added bitumen processing to crude oil using bitumen upgrading so you can turn wood into crude oil
    - Added wood-gasification-to-oil as a new researchable technology after advanced wood gasification
    - Updated the balancing.xls to show the calculations behind the wood-gasification-to-oil recipe
    - Updated the source.psd after creating the graphics for the new wood-gasification-to-oil recipe and technology
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed wood (and water) showing up as raw product for other oil-related products (this should be crude oil, not wood)
    - Fixed the graphics by removing the coal that was still in there from older versions
  Notes:
    - Just FYI: this version of the mod still works with 0.17.x
  Broke:
    - The Russian and German translations probably need work since I used Google translate for the new tech.
    - I tried not to break too much, but your wood processing setups probably need some love and attention.
